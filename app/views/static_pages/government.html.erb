        <h3>Inter-Agency Coordination</h3>

        <p>Crisis Cleanup helps organizations that <em>interact directly with survivors</em>, as they fix damaged property after a disaster. Crisis Cleanup is designed to be used by people who carry shovels and wear boots, not suits. Making sure that the system remains useful to workers and team leaders on the ground, as well as maintaining the trust and respect of the participating organizations are the project's top priorities.</p>
        <p>As a side-effect of normal usage, Crisis Cleanup becomes a repository of valuable data to other relief and government agencies. Our goal is to respect the privacy of clients while while sharing de-identified disaster information with as many organizations as possible, to promote the public welfare and a speedy recovery efforts. To that end, <em>in the future (BUT NOT CURRENTLY)</em>, Crisis Cleanup will permit multiple levels of access to organizations that meet some (but not all) of the <a title="Link: #requirements" href="https://crisiscleanup.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200603007#requirements">basic requirements</a>.</p>
        <p><a href="/contact">Contact Us</a> if you have any questions.</p>
        <!--<p><a href=""><button>Sign Up as Government!</button></a></p>-->

        <h3>Government Access</h3>
        <p>Crisis Cleanup adopts the Federal Government's access policy to the Coordinated Assistance Network (CAN). Federal, State and Local governments may have access to Preliminary Damage Assessment (PDA) information to promote general situational awareness, but does not provide direct access to client identifying information.</p>
        <p>Most government entities do not directly interact with disaster survivors and remediate private property. To promote survivor confidentiality and preserve the trust of participating organizations, government entities may participate by invitation only, and only with <em><a href="#situational_awareness_access">Situational Awareness Access</a></em> (when that access becomes available).</p>
        <p>If a government entity needs detailed survivor information, they may request it directly from recovery organizations. Government entities seeking exceptions to this policy should first get buy-in from relief organizations on the ground, and approval by the <a title="Link: #localadmin" href="https://crisiscleanup.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200603007#localadmin">Local Coordinator</a>.</p>
        <p><em><strong>Note to the occasional aggressive OEM</strong>: Please do not waste your time and ours by threatening, bullying, or demanding unfettered access to Crisis Cleanup. We don't feel that the data is ours to give to you, and bullying won't help your case. If you need more data, don't waste your time trying to convince us; talk to your local VOADs and relief organizations. They are authorized to release any information they deem appropriate.</em></p>
        <p>In the unusual event that a Government agency meets <em>all</em> of the <a href="https://crisiscleanup.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200603007#requirements">requirements</a> (including actually performing muck-outs or needs assessments, etc.), it will be given <em><a title="Link: #access" href="#recovery_access">Recovery Access</a></em>.</p>

    <h4>Real Innovation</h4>
    <p>The real innovation of this system is the ability to coordinate tens of thousands of volunteers from dozens of organizations to thousands of sites after a disaster. Crisis Cleanup proves that it is possible to create a near frictionless technological platform where inter-organization Cooperation, Communication, Coordination, and Collaboration is not only convenient, but required.
    </p>
    <h4>Turnkey Solution</h4>
    <p>Crisis Cleanup free to reputable voluntary relief organizations, and can be deployed with 6-hours' notice (or less). There are no size or declaration requirements.</p>

    <h4>Impact and Return on Investment (ROI)</h4>
<p>Crisis Cleanup is not-for-profit, which means we don't measure ROI in dollars, but in community impact. Impact measurements include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>31</strong>: Number of disaster relief efforts assisted since July, 2012.</li>
    <li><strong>21</strong>: States in which Crisis Cleanup has been used.</li>
    <li><strong>4</strong>: Number of countries using Crisis Cleanup.</li>
    <li><strong>400+</strong>: Number of relief organizations that have used Crisis Cleanup, Worldwide</li>
    <li><strong>25%</strong>: Approximate increase in volunteer efficiency through elimination of time spent on travel, coordination, collaboration, and management.</li> <!-- Estimate 5 hours per volunteer, per week. Save 1.25 hours in travel to and from command center, reassignment, frustrated volunteers who can't get reassigned and quit early, etc. -->
    <li><strong>16,000+</strong>: Households assisted, worldwide.</li> <!-- Count from database -->
    <li><strong>40,000+</strong>: Volunteers who have directly or indirectly used Crisis Cleanup.</li> <!-- Experience -->
    <li><strong>900,000+</strong>: Number of volunteer hours facilitated.</li> <!-- Sandy = 300K. Extrapolate: *3, to 16,000 sites from ~5,000. -->
    <li><strong>225,000+</strong>: Volunteer hours to survivors enabled by Crisis Cleanup that would have otherwise been wasted in management, travel, and overhead.</li> <!-- 900K*.25 -->
    <li><strong>$1.5 Million</strong>: Minimum value FEMA offset value to local governments in the United States.</li> <!-- 75K hours * $20/hour -->
    <li><strong>$30 Million</strong>: Minimum market value of services to survivors, enabled by redirecting volunteers to serving survivors rather than management and overhead.</li> <!-- Estimate 75% of 16,000 were helped. (12,000) 25% of those could not have otherwise been helped without CCU (3,000). Value of work per home = $10K. -->
    <li><strong>For every $1 invested in Crisis Cleanup, survivors have received <u>$69</u> in value.</strong></li>
