          <p>Crisis Cleanup helps relief organizations help more people.</p>
          <p>Crisis Cleanup is a collaborative disaster work order management platform. It improves coordination,
            decreases duplication of efforts, enhances efficiency, and improves the volunteer experience. Crisis Cleanup
            works best when a large number of voluntary organizations with a lot of volunteers, work together to help a
            large number of people over a wide area, all at the same time.</p>
          <p>Crisis Cleanup helps with the "4Cs" of disaster recovery:
            <em>Communication, Coordination, Collaboration, and Cooperation,</em> as well as Competition. Crisis Cleanup
            does <strong>not</strong> create the "4Rs" of disaster recovery: Relationships, Resources, Roles, and
            Responsibilities. It cannot fix relationships, create resources, or dictate who does what.</p>
          <p>Crisis Cleanup is for collaborative work order management; not volunteer, donations or case management. To
            protect clients, <strong>Crisis Cleanup is about property, not people.</strong></p>

          <h5 class="basic">Crisis Cleanup embraces and supports the interests of disaster survivors by providing
            transparent, collaborative, and privacy-enhancing open source technology to assist those who directly
            interact with and help survivors.</h5>
          <p>Crisis Cleanup is an open source project and operates through the fiduciary agent Crisis Cleanup, LLC based
            out of New Jersey. We are currently looking for a non-profit fiscal agent. Other organizations sponsor
            implementations of Crisis Cleanup in Australia, India, the Philippines, and elsewhere.</p>

          <h4>Foundational Philosophies:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The right way to do things is however it gets done, locally.</li>
            <li>Technology should enhance, not replace, inter-organization relationships.</li>
            <li>There is no pyramid, and you're not on top. Voluntary organizations are co-equal, sovereign and
              interdependent; no single organization is in charge.
            </li>
            <li>Collaboration and communication should be not only convenient, but required.</li>
            <li>There is no such thing as the “One App to Rule them All.” The system should not try to do things it was
              not intended to do.
            </li>
            <li>The system tracks property, not people. Consequently, strict personal information minimization policies
              are in place.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Crisis Cleanup's real innovation is the ability to coordinate tens of thousands of volunteers from
            hundreds of organizations to thousands of sites after a disaster in a non-hierarchical collaborative
            environment</strong>. Crisis Cleanup proves that it is possible to create a near frictionless technological
            platform where inter-organization Cooperation, Communication, Coordination, and Collaboration is not only
            convenient, but required.</p>

As far as they can see, there is nothing more to do, and are about to demobilize. They join Crisis Cleanup and see that there are thousands of other homes that need help. They re-engage for several more weeks, helping dozens more families. <u>Improved efficiency: 100%-300%</u><br/><br /><strong>Assessments w/ Crisis Cleanup</strong>: 2-3 volunteers knock doors. One assessment takes 15-45 minutes, or 30-135 volunteer minutes.<br /><strong>Assessments w/out Crisis Cleanup</strong>: A survivor calls the Crisis Cleanup hotline. The assessment takes 7 minutes. <u>Improved efficiency: 76%-98%</u>.<br /><br /><strong>Deployment without Crisis Cleanup</strong>: Team of 10 drives 30 mins to a command center or VRC. They wait for 90 minutes to check in and get paper work orders. Then, they drive 45 mins to assigned location. They have wasted 27.5 volunteer-hours in travel and overhead.<br /><strong>Deployment with Crisis Cleanup</strong>: The team leader logs into the system on a Wednesday. He or she claims a few work orders, calls the home owner and arranges a time to meet on the weekend. Team of 10 skips the line and goes straight to work. They only spend 7.5 volunteer-hours in travel before working. After they are done, they log in, update the map, and claims a nearby work order. Combined, the team saves 20-50 volunteer-hours more each day helping people, instead of traveling. <u>Improves efficiency by 25%-60%</u>."><i class="fi-info"></i></span> Increase in volunteer efficiency through re-engagement and elimination of time spent on travel, coordination, collaboration, and management.</li>
