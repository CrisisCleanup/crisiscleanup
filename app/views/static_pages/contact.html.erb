				<ul>
					<li><strong>If your home has been damaged:</strong> Call 800-451-1954 after major disasters. After local disasters, call 2-1-1 or the American Red Cross.</li>
					<li><strong>American Red Cross, 2-1-1, FEMA, etc:</strong> Do not refer the public to crisiscleanup.org. Crisis Cleanup does not provide direct-to-client services. Crisis Cleanup only serves relief agencies. It is a coordination platform for cleanup crews. After major disasters, refer them to 800-451-1954 or 844-965-1386 to be placed on the map.</li>
					<li><strong>Volunteers:</strong> Unfortunately, Crisis Cleanup does not take volunteers directly (unless you are a Ruby/JS/Postgres developer). Volunteer through a relief agency to use Crisis Cleanup.</li>
					<li><strong>Tech Support:</strong> For technical support, contact us through our <a href="https://crisiscleanup.zendesk.com/hc">Help and Support Desk</a>. Or email help@[thiswebsite], send a tweet to <a href="https://twitter.com/CrisisCleanup">@CrisisCleanup</a>, <!--reach us on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Crisis-Cleanup/437690172982553?fref=ts">Facebook Page</a> (not always monitored), -->or call (848) 480-0660 (as volunteers are available).
