        <h3>A New Philosophy For Disaster Relief</h3>
        <p><strong>Mission: To optimize disaster recovery service delivery through decentralized collaboration.</strong></p>
        <iframe class="about-intro" width="" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yCxI5YHyX5k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>Crisis Cleanup helps relief organizations help more people.</p>
        <p>Crisis Cleanup is a collaborative disaster work order management platform. It improves coordination, decreases duplication of efforts, enhances efficiency, and improves the volunteer experience. Crisis Cleanup works best when a large number of voluntary organizations with a lot of volunteers, work together to help a large number of people over a wide area, all at the same time.</p>
        <p>Crisis Cleanup helps with the "4Cs" of disaster recovery: <em>Communication, Coordination, Collaboration, and Cooperation,</em> as well as Competition. Crisis Cleanup does <strong>not</strong> create the "4Rs" of disaster recovery: Relationships, Resources, Roles, and Responsibilities. It cannot fix relationships, create resources, or dictate who does what.</p>
        <p>Crisis Cleanup is for collaborative work order management; not volunteer, donations or case management. To protect clients, <strong>Crisis Cleanup is about property, not people.</strong></p>

            <h5 class="basic">Crisis Cleanup embraces and supports the interests of disaster survivors by providing transparent, collaborative, and privacy-enhancing open source technology to assist those who directly interact with and help survivors.</h5>
        <p>Crisis Cleanup is an open source project and operates through the fiduciary agent Crisis Cleanup, LLC based out of New Jersey. We are currently looking for a non-profit fiscal agent. Other organizations sponsor implementations of Crisis Cleanup in Australia, India, the Philippines, and elsewhere.</p>

        <h4>Foundational Philosophies:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The right way to do things is however it gets done, locally.</li>
                <li>Technology should enhance, not replace, inter-organization relationships.</li>
                <li>There is no pyramid, and you're not on top. Voluntary organizations are co-equal, sovereign and interdependent; no single organization is in charge.</li>
                <li>Collaboration and communication should be not only convenient, but required.</li>
                <li>There is no such thing as the “One App to Rule them All.” The system should not try to do things it was not intended to do.</li>
                <li>The system tracks property, not people. Consequently, strict personal information minimization policies are in place.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><strong>Crisis Cleanup's real innovation is the ability to coordinate tens of thousands of volunteers from hundreds of organizations to thousands of sites after a disaster in a non-hierarchical collaborative environment</strong>. Crisis Cleanup proves that it is possible to create a near frictionless technological platform where inter-organization Cooperation, Communication, Coordination, and Collaboration is not only convenient, but required.</p>

    <li><strong>25%</strong>: Increase in volunteer efficiency through elimination of time spent on travel, coordination, collaboration, and management.</li> <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip tip-bottom" title="Here are two illustrations:<br/><strong>Assessment:</strong><br /><u>Without Crisis Cleanup</u>: A group of two to three volunteers knocks on doors, having discussions with residents. Each of these conversations, plus travel time and time spent by other volunteers waiting for work orders can take 15-45 minutes for each home. This equates to 30-135 volunteer-minutes per assessment.<br /><u>With Crisis Cleanup</u>: Volunteers answer calls as a part of a virtual call center, and enter work orders into Crisis Cleanup. The preliminary assessment is done in 7 minutes by one volunteer. This saves 23-128 volunteer minutes per assessment (<em>76-94% efficiency gain</em>)<br/><br /><strong>Volunteer Deployment</strong><br /><u>Without Crisis Cleanup</u>: A team of 10 volunteers drives 30 minutes to a command center. There they wait for 1 ½ hours to get checked in and receive their paper work assignments. Afterward, they drive another 45 minutes to their assigned location. This equates to 27.5 volunteer-hours spent in travel, management, and check-in.<br /><u>With Crisis Cleanup</u>: The team leader logs into Crisis Cleanup on Wednesday. They claim a work order, call the home owner and arrange a time to meet on Saturday. On Saturday morning, the 10 volunteers skip the line, and drive 45 minutes to the location. This equates to 7.5 volunteer-hours spent in travel, management and check-in.
