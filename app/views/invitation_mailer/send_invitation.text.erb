If you're new to Crisis Cleanup, the system helps multiple non-profits communicate, coordinate, or work together easily in the chaotic days and weeks after a disaster. Crisis Cleanup lets organizations see the entire picture, seamlessly coordinate, minimize duplication of efforts, while improving the volunteer experience and efficiency. It has been used to coordinate relief efforts in more than two dozen disasters since Hurricane Sandy.

Crisis Cleanup takes a "Craigslist" approach to disaster recovery: Organizations that are aware of a need enter the information in the system. Then organizations with capacity claim the work order and help as soon as they can. When everyone uses the system, tens of thousands of volunteers from hundreds of organizations go straight to work, and each organization knows where the others are working. Crisis Cleanup makes coordination and communication seamless, while giving voluntary organizations maximum flexibility to respond as they see fit.

If you have a few minutes (we know, they're hard to come by in the middle of a disaster), here's a short YouTube intro to how Crisis Cleanup fits into disaster recovery: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCxI5YHyX5k.
