    <h4>"Back of the Pickup Truck Invite:"</h4>
    <p>Let's say you're in the field on the back of a pickup truck, and you want to quickly sign up a team of 25 people. You're clearly not going to type in everybody's email on your phone. <br />Instead, click this button and the system will generate a random password (good for 30 minutes). Shout that password from the back of the pickup, and your entire team uses that temporary password to register, in minutes. They're automatically pre-approved, then they choose their own password.</p>
